// 25.	Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
// • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
// First Version Of The Program That Passes If Test
var alienColor_1_25 = 'green'; // Color # 1
if (alienColor_1_25 === 'green') { // Making Conditional Statement That If Condition Is True Continue This Piece Of Code Orelse Leave This Piece Of Code Unexecuted
    console.log("Congratulations! You Just Earned 5 Points!"); // Printing A Message Of Points
}
// Second Version Of The Program That Fails If Test
var alienColor_2_25 = 'yellow'; // Color # 2
if (alienColor_2_25 === 'green') {
    console.log("Congratulations! You Just Earned 5 Points!");
}
